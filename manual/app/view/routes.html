<h1>Routes</h1>


<p>Routes are a way in which the clients can be reach a resource from application.</p>
<p>At first, you don't need setup any route in config file because there are a implicit route, for example, if you have a <em>controller/admin.php</em> file (Admin class) and a <em>login</em> method, you can access it by using <em>/admin/login</em> in URI request.</p>
<p>If you need more specific routes, there are some rules that you can use to build it.</p>
<p>The default configuration to routes are within config file at <em>config/config.php</em> in application directory.</p>
<p>Each route has five information: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>URI:</strong> Uniform Resource Identifier(i.e. http://maps.google.com/);</li>
    <li><strong>Method Request:</strong> POST, GET, PUT, DELETE or *;</li>
    <li><strong>Controller Name:</strong> Name of Controller class that will manage the request, stored in <em>controller/</em> directory;</li>
    <li><strong>Action Name:</strong> Public method name of Controller class to call;</li>
    <li><strong>Module:</strong> <em>(optional)</em> Name of module directory in which Controller file/class is stored;</li>
</ul>

<p>Code example:</p>

<pre>
// Direct match to 'posts' method from controller/BlogController.php
$route['/blog/posts']['*']  = Array('BlogController', 'posts');

// Same, but accept only POST method request
$route['/blog/posts']['post']  = Array('BlogController', 'posts');

// Same, but accept only GET method request
$route['/blog/posts']['get']  = Array('BlogController', 'posts');

// Same, but from a module Blogs (stored in module/Blogs)
$route['/blog/posts']['get']  = Array('BlogController', 'posts', 'Blogs');

// Using named params, each param is started and ended with ':', can be used one param per segment
$route['/posts/by/date/:year:/:month:']['*']  = Array('BlogController', 'byDate');

// There are by default, a NotFoundController, when resource can't be found.
$route['/notfound']['*'] = Array('NotFoundController', 'index');

</pre>

<p>By default, if not exist a method named in the class, the result page will be redirect to NotFoundController, but this behavior can be replaced by only declarate a <em>__call($method_name, $args)</em> method in controller class.</p>
